# If you run CAS for the fist time without these four keys it will be autogenerated and later you can copy-paste here (see /var/log/atlas/cas/cas.log after first start to copy these autogenerated keys)
# See also https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.0.x/installation/Configuring-SSO-Session-Cookie.html
#
# You cannot put here and arbitrary string key, because needs to be of some size, etc (better autogenerate leaving this empty, and later get them from the logs, copy here, and re-run the inventory)
